This knowledge gives you leverage in negotiations.<br><br>-Mutual Benefit: Aim for a win-win outcome where both parties feel they&#x27;ve gained something of value. Flexibility: Be prepared to offer alternatives that meet the client&#x27;s core needs while still aligning with your business goals.<br><br>-Patience: Don&#x27;t rush the negotiation. Giving the process the time it needs can lead to better outcomes for both parties.</p>
